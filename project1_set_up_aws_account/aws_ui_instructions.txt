Project 1: Set Up AWS Account - AWS Management Console Instructions

1. Go to https://aws.amazon.com/free/ and click "Create a Free Account."
2. Enter your email address, password, and choose an account name. Click "Continue."
3. Enter your contact information and payment details as prompted. AWS requires a credit/debit card for verification, but you can use the Free Tier.
4. Verify your email and phone number as instructed.
5. Once your account is created, sign in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/.
6. In the search bar, type "Billing" and select the Billing dashboard.
7. In the left menu, click "Billing preferences" and enable "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts." Save your preferences.
8. (Optional) Set up a billing alarm: In the search bar, type "CloudWatch" and go to the CloudWatch service. Click "Alarms" > "Create alarm." Follow the prompts to set an alarm for the "EstimatedCharges" metric.
9. Explore the AWS Console: Familiarize yourself with the navigation bar, services menu, and account settings.

Note: Account creation cannot be automated with CloudFormation. Proceed to the next project after your account is set up.
