## 🔧 AWS Services Used
- **AWS Account Management**: Free tier account setup
- **CloudWatch**: Billing alarms and monitoring
- **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Optional email notifications
- **Billing Dashboard**: Cost tracking and management

## 📝 Prerequisites
- Valid email address
- Credit or debit card for account verification
- Phone number for verification

## 🚀 Implementation Methods

### Method 1: AWS Management Console (Recommended for Learning)

#### Step 1: Create AWS Account
1. Navigate to [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
2. Click "Create a Free Account"
3. Provide email address, password, and account name
4. Complete contact information and payment verification
5. Verify email and phone number as instructed

#### Step 2: Initial Account Configuration
1. Sign in to [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to Billing Dashboard (search "Billing")
3. In left menu, select "Billing preferences"
4. Enable "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts"
5. Save preferences

#### Step 3: Set Up Billing Alarm (Optional but Recommended)
1. Navigate to CloudWatch service
2. Go to "Alarms" → "Create alarm"
3. Select "EstimatedCharges" metric
4. Configure threshold (e.g., $5 or $10)
5. Set up SNS notification if desired

#### Step 4: Explore AWS Console
- Familiarize yourself with navigation bar
- Explore services menu
- Review account settings

### Method 2: CloudFormation Template

⚠️ **Note**: Account creation cannot be automated with CloudFormation. Use the template only after your account is set up.

```bash
# Deploy the billing alarm
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name billing-alarm-stack \
  --template-body file://project1_set_up_aws_account.yaml
```

### `aws_ui_instructions.txt`
Detailed step-by-step instructions for AWS Console setup.

### `project1_set_up_aws_account.yaml`
CloudFormation template that creates:
- CloudWatch billing alarm
- Monitors estimated charges
- Triggers when charges exceed threshold

## 💰 Cost Estimation
- **AWS Account**: Free
- **CloudWatch Alarms**: First 10 alarms are free
- **SNS Notifications**: First 1,000 emails free per month
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $0 (within free tier limits)

## 🔍 Key Learning Points

### AWS Free Tier
- 12 months of free services for new accounts
- Always-free services (DynamoDB, Lambda, etc.)
- Trial services (free for short periods)

### Billing Best Practices
- Set up billing alerts immediately
- Monitor usage regularly
- Understand free tier limits
- Use AWS Cost Explorer for detailed analysis

### Security Considerations
- Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Use strong passwords
- Review and understand AWS shared responsibility model

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Verification Steps
1. ✅ AWS account successfully created
2. ✅ Can access AWS Management Console
3. ✅ Billing preferences configured
4. ✅ CloudWatch billing alarm created (if using CloudFormation)
5. ✅ Free tier usage alerts enabled

### Expected Outcomes
- Functioning AWS account with billing monitoring
- Understanding of AWS console navigation
- Basic knowledge of cost management tools

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Credit card verification fails**
   - Ensure card details are correct
   - Contact your bank if transactions are blocked
   - Try a different card if needed

2. **Phone verification issues**
   - Ensure phone number is entered correctly
   - Check for SMS/call blocking
   - Try automated call option

3. **CloudFormation stack fails**
   - Verify you're in correct AWS region
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Ensure SNS topic ARN is correct (if using notifications)

## 🧹 Cleanup Instructions
```bash
# Delete CloudFormation stack (if created)
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name billing-alarm-stack

# Verify deletion
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name billing-alarm-stack
```

⚠️ **Important**: You cannot delete an AWS account immediately. If you want to close your account permanently, follow AWS account closure process in the billing console.
