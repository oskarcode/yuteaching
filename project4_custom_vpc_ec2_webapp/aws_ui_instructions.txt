Project 4: Custom VPC, Security, and EC2 Web App Deployment - AWS Management Console Instructions

1. Create a VPC:
   - Go to VPC Dashboard > Your VPCs > Create VPC.
   - Name your VPC (e.g., CustomVPC), set IPv4 CIDR block (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16), leave other settings default, and create.

2. Create Subnets:
   - Go to Subnets > Create subnet.
   - Select your VPC, add a public subnet (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24) and a private subnet (e.g., 10.0.2.0/24).

3. Set Up Internet Gateway:
   - Go to Internet Gateways > Create internet gateway.
   - Attach it to your VPC.
   - Go to Route Tables, select the public subnet's route table, and add a route: Destination 0.0.0.0/0, Target: your Internet Gateway.

4. Create a Security Group:
   - Go to Security Groups > Create security group.
   - Attach to your VPC, allow inbound rules for HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) from your IP.

5. Create a Network ACL:
   - Go to Network ACLs > Create network ACL.
   - Associate with your VPC and public subnet.
   - Add inbound/outbound rules to allow HTTP (80), SSH (22), and ephemeral ports (1024-65535).

6. Launch an EC2 Instance:
   - Go to EC2 > Instances > Launch instance.
   - Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI, t2.micro, select your public subnet, and assign the security group.
   - Add a key pair for SSH access.
   - Launch the instance.

7. Deploy a Simple Web App:
   - SSH into your instance: ssh -i <your-key.pem> ec2-user@<public-ip>
   - Install a web server (e.g., sudo yum install -y httpd; sudo systemctl start httpd).
   - Create a simple index.html in /var/www/html.
   - Visit your EC2 public IP in a browser to see your web page.

8. Clean up resources when done to avoid charges.
